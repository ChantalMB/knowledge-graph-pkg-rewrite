Trafficking Culture - Researching the global traffic in looted objects Also known as: Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2007) Artefacts returned to Italy in 2007 after Italian investigations into illicit trading.  Note: Seized images related to the eventual return of the fourth-century BC sculptural group of two griffins attacking a fallen doe can be found in our Tracking Illicit Antiquities section. In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The accumulating evidence implicated Marion True, the then Curator of Antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum, and she was interviewed in 2001 by the Italian prosecutors. More evidence regarding the Getty’s involvement with the Italian antiquities trade came to light in Los Angeles, where the journalists Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino (2005; 2011) obtained more than 1,000 pages of internal Getty documents (which the Getty maintains were stolen). These documents showed that as early as 1985 the Getty had been aware that it had been acquiring material from dubious sources in Italy and Greece, but had continued to do so regardless. In November 2005, Marion True was charged in an Italian court with conspiring to receive stolen art. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation also caused several US art museums to return material to Italy. Foremost among them was the Getty. The Getty had already returned objects to Italy in 1996, 1999 and 2005. In January 2006, talks commenced between the Getty and Italian officials about further repatriations While Italy was keen to secure the return of fifty-two objects, the Getty was hoping to keep the number down to twenty-one. However, in June 2006, the Los Angeles Times revealed that an internal Getty review conducted in 2005 had reported that 350 of the museum’s antiquities had been acquired from dealers suspected or convicted of dealing in looted artefacts (Felch and Frammolino 2006; Felch and Frammolino 2011: 292). An agreement was reached in June 2006 (Getty 2006a), establishing grounds for a return of objects and future cultural collaborations, but it collapsed soon after (Felch and Frammolino 2011 292). In October 2006, an offer by the Getty to return twenty-six objects and to share ownership of the Cult Statue of a Goddess (88.AA.76) was turned down by Italy (Felch and Frammolino 2011: 294; Getty 2006b). This  prompted the Getty to announce unilaterally in November 2006 that it intended to return twenty-five of the objects claimed by Italy, together with an additional one that the Getty’s own research had shown to be suspect—26 in total (Getty 2006b; Felch and Frammolino 2011: 298).Sticking points for the Getty were Italian claims made on the Statue of a Victorious Youth (77.AB.30), and the Cult Statue of a Goddess, both of which the museum was refusing to return (J.P. Getty 2006b). Italian officials rejected the offer, threatening the Getty with a future policy of non-cooperation unless their full claim was met (David 2006). Finally, in August 2007, an agreement was reached whereby the Getty would return forty objects to Italy, including the Cult Statue of a Goddess, and would retain possession of the Statue of a Victorious Youth pending the outcome of ongoing legal proceedings in Italy. The agreement also provided for future collaborations between the Getty and cultural institutions in Italy (Getty 2007).

The Getty Aphrodite is a large (about 2.3 m tall) limestone and marble statue of a female deity, probably Aphrodite, Hera or Demeter, dating from 425–400 BC. It was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1988 and returned to Italy in 2007. Giacomo Medici is an Italian antiquities dealer who was convicted in 2005 of receiving stolen goods, illegal export of goods, and conspiracy to traffic. Gianfranco Becchina is an Italian antiquities dealer who has been convicted in Italy of illegally dealing in antiquities. On 5 February 1999, the J. Paul Getty Museum returned three artifacts to Italy after being informed that they had been stolen or illegally excavated. The J. Paul Getty Museum returned three objects to Italy in 2005 that were stolen or illegally exported. The Getty Museum returned a looted terracotta head of Hades to Italy. Jiri Frel was curator of antiquities at the J.Paul Getty Museum between 1973 and 1984, and was associated with several irregularities regarding museum acquisitions. Marion True was Curator of Antiquities at the J.Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles from 1986 until 2005. She was charged and tried in both Italy and Greece on offences related to antiquities smuggling, but never convicted. ‘Tombarolo’ is an Italian term (plural ‘tombaroli’), derived from the Italian word ‘tomba’, meaning tomb or grave.
