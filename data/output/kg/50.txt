Trafficking Culture - Researching the global traffic in looted objects Also known as: Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2005) The J. Paul Getty Museum returned three objects to Italy in 2005 that were stolen or illegally exported.  On 7 November 2005, responding to approaches made by the Italian Ministry of Culture, the J. Paul Getty Museum agreed to return three objects to Italy (Getty 2005): Paestan red-figure calyx krater, painted and signed by Asteas (81.AE.78). A photograph of this piece was discovered in 1994 in the glove compartment of a crashed car belonging to Italian customs officer and dealer Pasquale Camera, who was killed in the crash (Watson and Todeschini 2007: 10-15, 290). The krater had been discovered by a labourer working on a canal in the 1970s, traded to a smuggler for a pig, bought by dealer Gianfranco Becchina and sold to the Getty in 1981 for $275,000 (Slayman 2006; Godart and De Caro 2008: 176 no. 47). Stone stela with Greek funerary inscription. Said to be from Selinunte in Sicily. Etruscan candelabrum (90.AC.17). Stolen from the Guglielmi Collection and sold to the Getty in 1990 by Atlantis Antiquities (proprietors Robert Hecht and Jonathan Rosen) for $65,000 (Watson and Todeschini 2007: 84-7). Marion True had first seen this candelabrum together with its companion tripod in 1987 in the possession of Giacomo Medici and Robert Hecht (Felch and Frammolino 2011: 153).

Gianfranco Becchina is an Italian antiquities dealer who has been convicted in Italy of illegally dealing in antiquities. On 5 February 1999, the J. Paul Getty Museum returned three artifacts to Italy after being informed that they had been stolen or illegally excavated. Artefacts returned to Italy in 2007 after Italian investigations into illicit trading. The Getty Museum returned a looted terracotta head of Hades to Italy. Marion True was Curator of Antiquities at the J.Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles from 1986 until 2005. She was charged and tried in both Italy and Greece on offences related to antiquities smuggling, but never convicted. Operation Geryon was the name given by Italian Carabinieri to an investigation into the armed theft of eight antiquities from the castle of Melfi. ‘Tombarolo’ is an Italian term (plural ‘tombaroli’), derived from the Italian word ‘tomba’, meaning tomb or grave.
